 $class->new($str, $scheme)

    Returns a instance that is a MarpaX::ESLIF::URI::$scheme representation
    of $str, when $scheme defaults to _generic if there is no specific
    $scheme implementation, or if the later fails.

NOTES

    Percent-encoded characters are decoded to ASCII characters
    corresponding to every percent-encoded byte.
