=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

MarpaX::ESLIF::URI::ftp inherits, and eventually overwrites some, methods or MarpaX::ESLIF::URI::_generic.

=head2 $class->bnf

Overwrites parent's bnf implementation. Returns the BNF used to parse the input.

=cut

sub bnf {
  my ($class) = @_;

  join("\n", $BNF, MarpaX::ESLIF::URI::_generic->bnf)
};

=head2 $class->grammar

Overwrite parent's grammar implementation. Returns the compiled BNF used to parse the input as MarpaX::ESLIF::Grammar singleton.

=cut

sub grammar {
  my ($class) = @_;

  return $GRAMMAR;
}

=head2 $self->to($type)

Returns the addresses as an array reference, that can be empty. C<$type> is either 'decoded' (default value), 'origin' or 'normalized'.

=cut

sub to {
    my ($self, $type) = @_;

    return $self->_generic_getter('_to', $type)
}

=head2 $self->headers($type)

Returns the headers as an array reference of single hashes, that can be empty. C<$type> is either 'decoded' (default value), 'origin' or 'normalized'.

There is no check of eventual duplicates, and it is reason why at every array indice, there is a hash reference where the key is a mailto header field, and the value is a mailto header value.

=cut

sub headers {
    my ($self, $type) = @_;

    return $self->_generic_getter('_headers', $type)
}

# Specific grammar actions

    #
    # <to> is also the <path> from generic URI point of view
    #
    $self->_action_path(@args);

    my $concat = $self->__concat(@args);

        foreach my $type (qw/origin decoded normalized/) {

            push(@{$self->_to->{$type}}, $addr->{$type})
        }

    my ($self, $hfname, $equal, $hfvalue) = @_;

    my $concat = $self->__concat($hfname, $equal, $hfvalue);

      $self->_headers->{$type} //= [];
      push(@{$self->_headers->{$type}}, { $hfname->{$type} => $hfvalue->{$type} })
    }

    return $concat
}

sub __hfname {
  my ($self, @args) = @_;

  #
  # <hfname> is case-insensitive. Since it may contain percent encoded characters that
  # are normalized to uppercase, we have to apply uppercase in normalization.
  #
  my $rc = $self->__concat(@args);
  $rc->{normalized} = uc($rc->{normalized});
  $rc

# Normalization

=head1 NOTES

The characters C</> and C<?> has been added to mailto syntax
